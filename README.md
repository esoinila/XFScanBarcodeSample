# XFScanBarcodeSample

Sample code for scanning barcodes with ZXing and Xamarin.Forms for my video here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwVtlT3E7fw&list=PLfbOp004UaYUgjhTHjtSixo-iMdz6PhIv&index=1

Modifield the code so that the scanned code is displayed in an edit field so that the received information can be copypasted.

Cool to think about using changing QR-code images as ultra-secure way to input and output data from a foil-wrapped-air-gapped true-random-one-time-pad-decrypter/encrypter. 
The data would only go one way at a time. Maybe add a beep sound to tell a frame was received and now ready for next QR-code-dataframe.

In practise at this stage this is just a way to transmit from iOS to Android diffcult to write text strings by using camera and QR codes.
